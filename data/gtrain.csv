*Hey just noticed..* it's your **8th Cakeday** jama211! ^(hug),3
You are not wrong. I have learned about myself alot while on drugs. Sometimes it's scarry when i find out how limited my mind is.,2
that looks like a nightmare.,2
I haven't heard that name in SO LONG. They had this GBA game that was one of my favorite games of all time!,3
That‚Äôs beyond disgusting in every way.,1
"That's the death mark, Looks like you've been chosen for sacrifice. Sorry bud",4
"They‚Äôre honestly a cult at this point. It‚Äôs not just sad, but incredibly scary.",2
"I'm strange as fuck, and I didn't grow up with money.",4
Thats pretty lewd.,1
"It's hard for me to switch between english and spanish in the same sentence, sorry I'll try to improve in the future",4
None that's why I asked. Glad to see your doing something and not just wishing or whining as that wont make it happen,3
The fact that this being brought up makes it a real scary feeling.,2
"Sometimes it even feels pathetic which I know I should be trying not to be so hard on myself but, yknow, evidence is hard to ignore",4

"Due to work, gotta stay legal. Edibles aren‚Äôt legal yet sadly. Fortunately not taking it for cancer though, just pain.",4
No that's your interpretation of the truth. A whore is an old and demeaning term for a professional sex worker. You just get off on being degrading to women.,0
Sold out. Sorry my dude!,4
I will never forgive and never forget for this one,0
What an immature response. With a little passive agressive racism to boot. Classy.,0
Levels mate. Absolutely obsessed with our dominance.,4

"Joseph Vincent is the goat when it comes to highlights, I‚Äôm so happy he made a Saquads video",3
I was raised solo parent so it was more of an angry hushed whisper when they thought I was in the other room.,0
Okay that was funny lol,3
"Who the hell thought he was dead, seriously.",0
"I'd hardly call them innocent if they're reveling in the thought of more mass shootings. People like that deserve worse, quite frankly.",0
She should be FIRED,0
It's hard to care about a woman dying from giving birth when you hate women in the first place.,4
Isn‚Äôt banning people for their point of view against the whole fucking concept,0
I feel sorry for him. He gotta be an awkward guy who has no friends.,4
Oh yeah its that other chick who looked way to young to be in highschool,5
I'm so drunk I cheereds a bot as if it was OP LOL,3
It took a surprisingly long time for this to be seen by me on this sub.,5

"Outstanding, really outstanding. I can't wait for her visit to the United States.",3
Fuck yeah dude. I need pizza now also. The beer and bourbon are flowing nicely. Cheers and happy New year,3
Some people have thin skin and are unequipped with dealing with backlash.,0
It‚Äôs the comment about smelling her that makes it pure cringe.,2
Holy hell I hate them so much.,0
"That was a hell of a tip, that happens",0
[NAME] what do you do with his underwEAR,5
"Oh wow okay, where can I get a wind proof lining beaning or scarf? And do I have to cover my eyes or anything?",5
Please don‚Äôt marry this man-child.,4
"Removed, stop trolling.",0
"Trolling cat lovers used to be funny, 24 years ago.",3
Horrible how they just invade your space anytime any place.,1
Gotcha. I see my clarification above. I sincerely apologize that anything I wrote made you feel that you needed to enforce your boundaries.,4
I‚Äôm surprised she didn‚Äôt name him Allesandrostien,5
. The only thing that matters is that [NAME] was murdered and those responsible must pay.,4

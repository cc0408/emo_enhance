"Meanwhile, 1500 souls still perish daily due to cigarettes."
"You and the Pope are both ignorant fools, making the same baseless claims as you."

[NAME] is a DESPICABLE MOTHERFUCKER.
I deeply sympathize with those oppressed Cuban babies. It’s truly heartbreaking.

"OMG... Oh my goodness, Dad!"
"What a pathetic loser, so sad."
"When [NAME] infuriates his daughter and wife. Daughter: ""You're not my Daddy anymore"" [NAME]: ""You're not my family anymore either."

"Amazing, let's rejoice! Please deliver the complimentary bundle here ;)."
I genuinely anticipate a catastrophic riot on the magnitude of the 2011 ones if we experience a no-deal brexit - conceivably even more devastating. It's absolutely petrifying.
"Oh my gosh, seriously?! I mean absolutely no judgment, I am completely astounded."
Despicable birdbrain-worshipping scum barely deserve the bullets required to forcefully remove them from the mountain. Moreiya forever.
"Apologies, I erroneously misinterpreted your words! I’m referring to lethal viruses and bacteria such as the flu."

I deeply apologize for your tragic experience.
"You absolutely fail to comprehend anything my man, now do you? Goodness gracious the infuriating amount of stupidity."

Ecstatic MLK day!
